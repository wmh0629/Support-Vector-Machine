SVM differs from the other classification algorithms 
in the way that it chooses the decision boundary 
that maximizes the distance from the nearest data points of all the classes. 


Simple SVMs can only classify linearly separable data. 


In case of non-linearly separable data, 
the simple SVM algorithm cannot be used. 
Rather, a modified version of SVM, called Kernel SVM, is used.
